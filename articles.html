                    <p>I get a lot of questions about the software I use to run my business. This week, I decided to definitively answer those questions by creating a resource for you; Thomas Frank’s Tools, Apps, and Resources. This giant Notion database lists all the apps I use for video editing, motion graphics, business administration, website design […]</p>

                    <p>YouTube is designed to keep you clicking from video to video, lengthening your overall session time. You can see evidence of this goal in the design of every page; from the homepage to a single video’s page, you’re bombarded with lots of suggested videos. Here’s the problem: These suggested videos often encourage you to give […]</p>

                    <p>It might not have looked this way on the surface, but I’ve spent the last 8-9 months of my life in what I now realize was a mild depression. It wasn’t bad enough for me to realize what it was while I was in the midst of it, especially since I’ve spent the last 10 […]</p>

                    <p>These are my personal notes on The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. I took them in 2014 when I read the book for the first time, and they are unedited. If you’d like to read the whole thing, you can buy the book on Amazon (and I’ll get a small commission at no extra cost to […]</p>

                    <p>I’m often asked for advice on how to get into the work that I do – making YouTube videos, podcasts, blog posts, etc. Since I’ve talked about these subjects in several places, I’m going to list them all here. When I’m interviewed on more podcasts in the future, or release other resources, I’ll add them […]</p>

                    <p>Over a hundred years ago, during World War I, a Chicago newspaper found itself being sued by Henry Ford for libel. The paper had labeled Ford an “ignorant pacifist”, and during the trial it attempted to defend the statement by asking Ford a bunch of general knowledge questions in the hopes of exposing his ignorance.

                    <p>This is not rich people vs. poor people. There are many poor people with a rich mindset, financially poor due to circumstance. And there are many trust fund babies with a poor mindset. Rich mindset understands that the first goal is to gain a surplus of resources. Then, to use that surplus to accelerate things. […]</p>
